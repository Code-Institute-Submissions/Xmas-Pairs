# XMAS PAIRS

This project is a simple yet challenging memory game with a user-friendly design. The goal of the project is to create a game
that is both fun and challenging for users of all ages. The game will shuffle the cards at the start of each game and have a time limit to beat.

## UX

### Player Experience

- Players immediately experience an easy, clear and intuitive understanding of the game right away. Simple controls allow the player to promptly understand how to play the game. 

- Inviting Christmas sounds & bright colours have been featured to give the player a festive feel.
Winning & losing features have also been included with modal pop-ups & sounds to provide the player with additional challenges and goals to achieve.

- The player has no need for a back button or to reload the page. Easy and informative buttons have been provided at all times to ensure the
the player has an easy way around the game.

### User Stories

### As a player, I'd like to see:
    - A professional and strong looking game to draw the player into playing.
    - Simple and easy to use controls to ensure that the game is not difficult to control.
    - An information window showing clear information about how the game is played to avoid confusion.
    - A sense of achievement and a goal to strive for whilst playing the game.
    - Professional sounds which give a nice feel to their specific purpose.

### Design Ideas

The design of the game is intended to replicate the old classic matching pairs game with a slightly modernized touch to it.

### Wireframes

[Here](https://github.com/Verga1/Xmas-Pairs/tree/master/wireframes) are the designs I made for the site.
